## About Project 

This project is based on machine learning and its algorithms which predicts a student's curricular score according to the numbers of hours devoted to his studies. I created a machine learning model trained on hour to score ratio dataset built on Linear Regression algorithms which predicts the estimated marks scored by a student according to the numbers of hours devoted to his studies. The model give an accuracy of 85% on the testing dataset.
